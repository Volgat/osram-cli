# About Osram CLI

## Overview

Osram CLI is a powerful command-line interface that provides developers with seamless access to multiple AI providers through a unified tool. Designed for efficiency and adaptability, it enables developers to leverage different AI models without switching between different tools or interfaces.

## Mission

Our mission is to streamline the development workflow by integrating AI assistance directly into the command line. We aim to bridge the gap between developers and AI technologies, making it easier to harness the power of artificial intelligence for everyday development tasks.

## Core Values

- **Efficiency**: Optimize development workflows by reducing context switching between tools.
- **Flexibility**: Support multiple AI providers to give developers freedom of choice.
- **Simplicity**: Provide intuitive commands that make complex operations accessible.
- **Innovation**: Continuously evolve with the rapidly changing AI landscape.

## Key Features

### Multi-Provider Integration
Osram CLI abstracts away the complexities of different AI provider APIs, allowing you to switch between providers with a single command. Currently supports:
- Zhipu AI
- Anthropic Claude
- Google Gemini
- OpenAI

### Project Analysis
Comprehensive analysis tools help you understand and improve your codebase:
- Structure analysis
- Dependency mapping
- Code quality metrics
- Automated reporting

### Natural Language Interface
Interact with your development environment using natural language commands:
- File operations
- Code generation
- Project management
- Git operations

### Extensible Architecture
Built with a modular design that makes it easy to:
- Add new AI providers
- Extend functionality with plugins
- Customize for specific workflows

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.7+**: Core language chosen for its versatility and extensive ecosystem
- **Click**: Elegant framework for creating powerful command-line interfaces
- **Rich**: Library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal
- **Requests**: Simplified HTTP library for API communication
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for caching and history management

## Architecture

Osram CLI is built with a clean, modular architecture:

- **Core Module**: Handles command parsing and main application flow
- **Provider Module**: Manages integrations with different AI services
- **Analysis Module**: Provides project analysis and reporting capabilities
- **Utils Module**: Contains shared utilities and helper functions

This modular design ensures maintainability and makes it easy to extend the tool with new features.
